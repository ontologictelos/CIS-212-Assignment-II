    <h1 class="center"> Mark P Richter </h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Mark. I am a student attending southern Illinois community college (<span>SWIC</span>) studying computer science (CS). Previously, I was a HH-60 mechanic for the Air Force.
        Before joining the Air Force I attended Evangel University in Springfield MO studying studio art, theology and philosophy. While I love those areas of study the job market for those skills are not really in demand.
        Luckily academically studying those areas does require a good amount of critical thinking, thus, once I learned about programming I found a career field I would enjoy and be challenged by while also learning a in 
        demand skill. I am still deciding as to whether or not to move on to a four year university after <span>SWIC</span> or not, I guess it depends on if I can get a job with just an associates or not.
    </p>
    <p> While I still study art, theology, and philosophy in my free time, now programming is quickly taking up alot of my plate. Thus, I've been really enjoying podcast as an alternative to reading books on the subjects.
        When I am not studying programming, art, theology or philosophy I find myself at church more often than not or at work. Currently, I work at Scooter's coffee in Mascoutah, which is just down the road from <span>SWIC</span>
        It is not my favorite coffee in the world but it helps pay the bills so I can't complain too much. I go to church at Saint's Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church in Swansea which is about a 10-15 min drive from <span>SWIC</span>
        At both of these place (Scooters and Church) I have been dubbed the "coffee guy". If looking for "good coffee" (while this is a subjective matter) I highly recommend Sump Coffee or Blueprint Coffee in Saint Louis.
    </p>
